# beginner-level-projects
This is my first portfolio for HTML and CSS projects. It's been created for me to document my education and skills evolution. Feel free to reach out if you have any best practices suggestions for my code.

# [Project 1: QR Code Component](https://github.com/cinthiacicilio/beginner-level-projects/blob/main/web-version.html)
* My challenge was to build out this QR code component.
* It was a good train for my eye for detail by getting my solution as close to the design as I could.
* It took me 3 hours to complete the project, it was the first web page I created after finishing the She Codes Basic Workshop.
